Started off this KBA much different than last. I decided to try and start by doing some of the requirements instead of an outline for my program. I will say I don't think that approach helped me very much in this SBA. 
I think a big part of my time spent was trying to fix my errors and that wasted a lot of my time doing so. Think I could have maybe relied on youtube or classmates more. 

My project is over a travel sign up website. Where you can find where in the world you want to vacation at.
Having a simple UserName and Password type setup. 

I tried to impliment some of the same things the Regex Form Validation example had as a reference. Though most of my code did not want to work together.
One thing I took from this is a wireframe seems rather important to collect your ideas. Also writing down what functions you want to have within the wireframe. 
I would have approached this SBA much differently doing it a second time. Just really tried to stress myself on the requirements and it backfired on me.
Overall I think I learned a lot from this project. A lot of it being debugging my code.
